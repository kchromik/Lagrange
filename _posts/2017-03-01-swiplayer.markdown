description: A swipe gesture-based video player for the Apple iPad

---

As part of my Master studies I had to design and implement a video player for the Apple iPad, which uses gesture controls only. The concept of the navigation within a photo library on a smartphone or tablet has been transferred to video navigation. A horizontal swipe gesture allows the user to jump temporary to a next/previous sequence in the video. Depending on the vertical position of the finger, the time interval of the scene jump adapts dynamically, which enables the user to execute fast but less detailed navigation.

### Features
* long-press on thumbnail triggers a short preview
* left/right swipe gesture for intra-video navigation
* dynamic intra-video navigation, depending on vertical position of the gesture
* two-finger tap to pause/resume video
* horizontal swipe to navigate to next/previous video
* playback of videos synchronized via iTunes
* playback of videos from camera roll

### Implementation
* Objective-C
* iOS SDK
* AVFoundation
